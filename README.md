# Glucamera
Glucamera is an application that utilizes camera sensor technology to detect the sugar content in food products. 

By capturing an image of the food, Glucamera provides real-time information about the sugar composition, empowering users to make informed decisions about their diet and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. It eliminates the complexity of understanding food labels and addresses the low interest in sugar content among the general public. Glucamera promotes transparency, offers personalized recommendations, and helps users monitor their sugar intake, ultimately contributing to improved public health.
